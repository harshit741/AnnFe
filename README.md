            <p>This website helps you to gather feedback from your collegues, friends, family,etc. Anonymous feedback can ease people who are new to giving feedback into the process. This is especially helpful when employees are giving upward feedback for the first time. Anonymity encourages people to give more honest feedback rather than passing on the opportunity or heavily diluting it with praise.</p>
            <p>Anonymity is one of the internet’s greatest offerings. You can easily mask your identity online, while still getting to do and say what you want to. This anonymity lends itself to more honesty, since there aren’t repercussions</p>
            <p>AnnFe helps you to gather feedback annonymously. Private, anonymous and actionable. What you don't know can cost you and your business — we make it easy to find out what's really on people's minds.</p>
